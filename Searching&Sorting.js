/*
Binary Search
 This function performs a binary search on a sorted array to find the index of a target value.
 https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/
 
 Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

// The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty.
// It calculates the middle index and compares the target with the value at that index.
// If the target is found, it returns the index; if the target is less than the middle value, it narrows the search to the left half; otherwise, it narrows to the right half.
// The function returns -1 if the target is not found in the array.
// This approach has a time complexity of O(log n) and a space complexity of O(1) since it uses only a few variables for indexing.

// The function uses a nested loop to repeatedly compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
// The outer loop runs n-1 times, and the inner loop runs n-i-1 times, where n is the length of the array.
// If no swaps are made during an inner loop iteration, the array is already sorted, and the function breaks out of the loop early.
// This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case and a space complexity of O(1) since it uses only a few variables for indexing and swapping.
